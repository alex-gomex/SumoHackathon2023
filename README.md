Perfect final question solution to Sydney Uni Mechantronics Organisation Annual Hackathon (2023). 
Involves using the matplotlib libraries in combination with a breadth-first search algorithm to find and visually render both the fastest and the "realistic" solution to a maze as based on the Maze Runner movies. 
This was a full-marks solution to the final and hardest question, which won the hackathon.

Hackathon Brief in "HackathonMainDoc.pdf". Main code in "MazeRunner.py". Takes in "maze.txt" as input, and outputs "directions.txt", "BestPath.gif" and "Exploration.gif".

Done in Year 2 Semester 1.
